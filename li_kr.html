                2.1. Grants
                
                Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
                non-exclusive license:
                
                (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
                    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
                    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
                    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
                    as part of a Larger Work; and
                
                (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
                    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
                    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
                
                2.2. Effective Date
                
                The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
                become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
                distributes such Contribution.
                
                2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
                
                The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
                this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
                distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
                Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
                Contributor:
                
                (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
                    or
                
                (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
                    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
                    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
                    Version); or
                
                (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
                    its Contributions.
                
                This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
                or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
                the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
                
                2.4. Subsequent Licenses
                
                No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
                distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
                License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
                permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
                
                2.5. Representation
                
                Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
                Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
                to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
                
                2.6. Fair Use
                
                This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
                applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
                equivalents.
                
                2.7. Conditions
                
                Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
                in Section 2.1.
                
                3. Responsibilities
                -------------------
                
                3.1. Distribution of Source Form
                
                All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
                Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
                the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
                Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
                License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
                attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
                Form.
                
                3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
                
                If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
                
                (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
                    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
                    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
                    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
                    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
                
                (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
                    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
                    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
                    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
                
                3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
                
                You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
                provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
                the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
                Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
                Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
                License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
                under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
                the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
                License(s).
                
                3.4. Notices
                
                You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
                (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
                or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
                the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
                the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
                
                3.5. Application of Additional Terms
                
                You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
                behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
                such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
                You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
                liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
                indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
                disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                jurisdiction.
                
                4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
                ---------------------------------------------------
                
                If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
                statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
                the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
                describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
                be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
                Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
                or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
                recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
                
                5. Termination
                --------------
                
                5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
                if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
                compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
                Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
                Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
                ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
                non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
                come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
                Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
                first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
                from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
                Your receipt of the notice.
                
                5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
                infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
                counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
                directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
                You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
                2.1 of this License shall terminate.
                
                5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
                end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
                have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
                prior to termination shall survive termination.

                8. Litigation
                -------------
                
                Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
                courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
                place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
                jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
                Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
                cross-claims or counter-claims.
                
                9. Miscellaneous
                ----------------
                
                This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
                matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
                unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
                that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
                shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
                
                10. Versions of the License
                ---------------------------
                
                10.1. New Versions
                
                Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
                10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
                publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
                distinguishing version number.
                
                10.2. Effect of New Versions
                
                You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
                of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
                or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
                steward.
                
                10.3. Modified Versions
                
                If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
                create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
                modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
                any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
                such modified license differs from this License).
                
                10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
                Licenses
                
                If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
                Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
                notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
                
                Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

                If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
                file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
                file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
                for such a notice.
                
                You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
